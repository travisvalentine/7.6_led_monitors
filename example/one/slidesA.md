# How it works #

* Moving an electron beam back and forth across the back of the screen. 
* Each time the beam makes a pass across the screen, it lights up phosphor dots on the inside of the glass tube, thereby illuminating the active portions of the screen.
* By drawing many such lines from the top to the bottom of the screen, it creates an entire screen of images

# LCD in a nutshell #

* LCD displays use two sheets of polarizing material with a liquid crystal solution between them
* An electric current passed through the liquid causes the crystals to align so that light cannot pass through them.
* Each crystal, therefore, is like a shutter, either allowing light to pass through or blocking the light.
* Color LCD displays use two basic techniques for producing color: Passive matrix is the less expensive of the two technologies. 
* The other technology, called thin film transistor (TFT) or active-matrix, produces color images that are as sharp as traditional CRT displays, but the technology is expensive

# LED vs LCD #

* The difference is in the backlight

# LED Backlighting #

* LEDs use LED backlighting instead of the cold cathode fluorescent (CCFL) backlighting used in most other LCDs
* The benefits: 
  * Faster Turn On: LEDs can reach maximum brightness faster than CCFLs, in fact almost instantly.
  * More Neutral Colors: CCFLs are known to give a warm/yellowish tint. LEDs have a more neutral whitepoint.
  * Brighter: LEDs are brighter generally than CCFLs, thus allowing a display to achieve even higher maximum brightness.
  * Thinner: The reason LEDs are coming into prominence is that it was driven by the notebook sectors - LED back-lighting can be made thinner than CCFL back-lighting.
  * Longer-Lasting: Apparently, LEDs are rated for more life than CCFLs. Also the degradation over time is less severe than CCFLs.
